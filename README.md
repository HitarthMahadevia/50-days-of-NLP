# 50 Days of NLP 🚀📚

### Welcome to the 50 Days of NLP Challenge!

This repository is dedicated to my journey of exploring and mastering Natural Language Processing (NLP) through a series of 50 projects. Each day, I will tackle a new NLP topic or project, starting from the basics and gradually moving towards more advanced concepts. Follow along as I dive into the fascinating world of text processing, machine learning, and deep learning applied to natural language.

### Goals and Objectives

- 📘 **Learn**: Enhance my understanding of NLP concepts and techniques.
- 🔧 **Implement**: Apply what I learn through hands-on projects.
- 🌐 **Share**: Document and share my progress to help others learn from my journey.
- 📈 **Grow**: Build a strong foundation in NLP and contribute to the community.

### How to Use This Repository

Each day's project will be contained in its own folder with the following structure:
