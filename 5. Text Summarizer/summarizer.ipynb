    "\n",
    "In this project, I explored two text summarization approaches and evaluated their performance using ROUGE metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extractive Summarization:**\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-1**: Precision: 0.3074, Recall: 0.9326, F-measure: 0.4624\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-2**: Precision: 0.2119, Recall: 0.6477, F-measure: 0.3193\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-L**: Precision: 0.2630, Recall: 0.7978, F-measure: 0.3955\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstractive Summarization using BART:**\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-1**: Precision: 1.0, Recall: 0.1686, F-measure: 0.2886\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-2**: Precision: 0.8710, Recall: 0.1011, F-measure: 0.1812\n",
    "   - **ROUGE-L**: Precision: 1.0, Recall: 0.1686, F-measure: 0.2886\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extractive Summarization** achieves high recall, capturing most key information but includes some irrelevant details.\n",
    "- **Abstractive Summarization** with BART shows high precision and generates concise summaries but may miss some key information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Future Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combining Approaches**: Integrate extractive and abstractive techniques.\n",
    "2. **Parameter Tuning**: Experiment with BART model parameters.\n",
    "3. **Exploring Other Models**: Use advanced models like T5 or PEGASUS.\n",
    "4. **Diverse Datasets**: Test on a variety of articles for robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practical Implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective text summarization aids in quickly grasping lengthy documents, crucial for news aggregation, research, and content curation. Continuous refinement can lead to more accurate and reliable summaries, enhancing automated summarization systems.\n"
